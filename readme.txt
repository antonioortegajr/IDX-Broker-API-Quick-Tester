Updated to new version of this tester.

This is a simple tester of API keys and calls to the IDX Broker API system.

All GET calls.

Not all calls are available in this tester.

Returns by default are json.

This tester is meant for validating the functionality of an API key or method.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

Only API methods from version 1.0.4 are used.

This tester only tests the GETS calls as shown in the current docs. This functions like a super super basic swagger.
