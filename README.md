Standard Disclaimer: This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code.


Updated to new version of this tester.

You will want to consult the official docs for API calls and consumption:

http://middleware.idxbroker.com/docs/api/1.1/index.php

This is a very simple tester of API keys and calls to the IDX Broker API.

All GETs calls.

Returns by default are json. Unless otherwise specified in middleware.

This tester is meant for validating the functionality of an API key or method.

This tester only tests the GETS calls as shown in the current docs.

This isn't very pretty,
but I did spend a lot of time writing json responses for pop culture reference when entered as the API key.

Pull requests welcome.
