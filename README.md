# IDX-Broker-API-Quick-Tester
Simple GET calls to test functionality of API keys and methods

READ ME

Standard Disclaimer: This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code.


This is a simple tester of API keys and calls to the IDX Broker API system.

All GET calls.

Returns by default (not set in request headers) are json unless ohter set in middleware.

This tester is meant for validating the functionality of an API key or method.

This tester only tests the GETS calls as shown in the current docs. This functions like a super super basic swagger.
