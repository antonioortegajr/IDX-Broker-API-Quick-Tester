#IDX-Broker-API-Quick-Tester

##Standard Disclaimer:
This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code.

##This project has moved:

This project will now be available at https://github.com/antonioortegajr/unofficial-idx-broker-tools

No new development will occur in this repo and the live tester will come down
for it's place on heroku at the end of the year.


Updated to new version of this tester.

You will want to consult the official docs for API calls and consumption:

http://middleware.idxbroker.com/docs/api/1.1/index.php

This is a very simple tester of API keys and calls to the IDX Broker API.

A valid IDX Broke API key is required.

####All GETs calls.

Returns by default are json. Unless otherwise specified in middleware.

This tester is meant for validating the functionality of an API key or method.

This tester only tests the GETS calls as shown in the current docs.

Live testing here: http://idx-api-tester.herokuapp.com/ This will no longer be live as of 1/1/17

This isn't very pretty,
but I did spend a lot of time writing json responses for pop culture reference when entered as the API key.

Enjoy!
